From this project we expect to find a moderate relationship between the continent the players are from and their current rank. A relationship between these two variables would express that a player's background plays a major role in how well they do in their tennis careers, and understanding this concept would create opportunities for advancement in the sport. This information is a stepping stone into further research on how specific training methods from countries and continents are more productive and yield better results in tennis competitions worldwide. This knowledge would then lead to more research options, further into how long the players have spent in their original countries and whether their chosen coaches and trainers follow the same training style. Researching to what extent the coach's background affects the player's results would be the next step in this process. A different subject that can be investigated based on the results of this project is how genetics plays a role in tennis, whether a certain physical trait causes a major advantage in training or even in play style.
